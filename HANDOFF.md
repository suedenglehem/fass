# HANDOFF — fass (natural language → validated FFmpeg commands)

## Goal
Implement plan0.md milestone 1: CLI-first pipeline (instruction → NLU → strict
EditPlan → planner → builder argv → POSIX render), 5 MVP ops (trim, resize,
grayscale, encode/convert, one watermark), 70+ deterministic tests, then a
50-request benchmark, real media-fixture outcome tests, README. No web UI yet.
Spec: ffmpeg-assistant-prd.md; guide: plan0.md.

**MILESTONE 1 COMPLETE (2026-10-23).** 162 tests pass (33 s): 70 deterministic
(schema, rules, planner/builder, render-adversarial, cli) + 78 language
benchmark + 10 media outcomes (synthetic lavfi) + 4 real-media (titan.mp4).

## Current state (2026-10-23)
- Pipeline, schema, registry, planner, builder, rules+LLM adapters, CLI,
  probe, feedback: COMPLETE and smoke-verified.
- Delegated via dispatcher (project `fass`, team mode, base 3bd8a76):
  - Job A `j_c58bc3ed95` (backend i7): INTEGRATED, merge cdd3f6d,
    dispatch_integrate accepted. 78-request benchmark + 5 rules.py bug fixes
    (range units, 'keep' trim verb, crop/stabilize regexes, revision negation
    precedence). Diff reviewed line-by-line.
  - Job B `j_95829e9a84` (backend tr4-secondary, 140B iq3xs): work INTEGRATED
    as merge 865a891 (tests/test_media.py, 219 lines, 10 tests), but the
    dispatcher records the job as FAILED (failure_class invalid_result: the
    worker's result.json used outcome "success" instead of "completed" and
    descriptive test-status strings). dispatch_integrate refuses failed jobs,
    so the bookkeeping stays failed/pending while the code is on main.
    Lesson: spell the exact result.json enum values in future job prompts
    (the iq3xs 140B writes good code but sloppy result JSON).
- media/titan.mp4 (6.3MB, 1280x720 h264+AAC 20.08 s, user-provided) committed;
  tests/test_titan.py (ab0dbdc) runs generated argv on it and probes outcomes.
- README.md written; roadmap checkboxes updated.

## Key decisions
- argv arrays are the source of truth; shell rendering is shlex.join only.
  Model-generated shell is never trusted (PRD security).
- `-ss` before `-i` (input option, fast seek) + `-t` output duration —
  trim always re-encodes (frame accuracy, PRD FR-4).
- Stream copy only when no ops/trim AND ffprobe metadata proves codecs match;
  no metadata → re-encode + visible default note.
- Output filename: default `{stem}.{ext}`, de-collided with `_out` suffix;
  explicit `-o` == input is a hard error. Never `-y`.
- Timecode convention: two fields = MM:SS, three fields = H:MM:SS.
- Rules adapter is deterministic/offline default; LLM adapter (Anthropic)
  shares the same pydantic envelope validation.
- Watermark: labeled filter_complex + `overlay`, `-map [vN] -map 0:a?`.

## Changed files (this milestone)
fass/{__init__,__main__,cli,pipeline,explain,feedback}.py,
fass/schema/{plan,registry?}.py (schema/), fass/registry/, fass/probe/,
fass/planner/, fass/builder/, fass/nlu/{rules,llm}.py,
tests/{conftest,test_schema,test_rules,test_planner_builder,
test_render_adversarial,test_cli}.py, pyproject.toml, .gitignore, HANDOFF.md

## Test results
`./.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` → **162 passed** in ~33 s, no failures.
Breakdown: 70 deterministic · 78 benchmark · 10 media (lavfi) · 4 titan.
venv has pydantic 2.14.1 + pytest 9.1.1; fass is NOT pip-installed
(cwd import) — run tests from repo root.

## Next steps
Milestone 1 done. Remaining:
1. Mycelium project memory for fass (in progress this session).
2. plan0 milestone 2 (when requested): FastAPI web layer over `generate()`,
   streaming progress, job history — the CLI `--json` response is the API
   contract already.
3. No commits/pushes beyond milestone work unless asked (no remote exists).

## Environment notes
- Python 3.12.3, `.venv` (PEP 668 blocks system pip) — use `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest`.
- ffmpeg 6.1.1 + ffprobe on PATH (main box).
- Dispatcher: fass project was `single` mode + had zero commits — switched to
  team and committed initial state (local, no push) to enable delegation.
